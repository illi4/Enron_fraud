# Using Machine Learning to identify Enron fraudsters

In this project, I will build a model for identifying potential fraudsters based on financial and e-mail data. For this, the following steps will be performed:

- data exploration (learning about the data, cleaning and preparing the data)
- feature selection and engineering (selecting the most significant features and creating new ones)
- reducing the dimensionality of the data using principal component analysis
- selection and tuning a supervised machine learning algorithms
- validating the algorithm to ensure acceptable performance of the model

## Results
The results are saved in the [Jupyter notebook file](Enron_final.ipynb) in the repository. 

## Files
The following additional files can be found in the repository: 
- Enron_final.html: results in the html format. 
- final_project_dataset.pkl: dataset in pkl format. 
- final_project_dataset_modified.pkl, my_classifier.pkl, my_dataset.pkl, my_feature_list.pkl: files created as a result of project implementation. 
- poi_id.py: script with the python code referred to in the results file, as well as the final classifier. 
- tester.py: script used to test the classifier. 
- tools folder: scripts used for data processing.
